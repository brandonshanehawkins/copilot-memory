## üß† Project Indexing & AI Agent Logging

All projects‚Äîbillable or not‚Äîfollow a consistent indexing format: ABCD-#####, where:



ABCD is a client or category code (e.g., FMCC = Ford Motor Credit Company, FRET = Ford Retail First).
- [#####] is a sequential number unique to that client or category.
To support internal R&D and AI exploration, the following prefixes are reserved:



EXAI ‚Äì Exploratory AI (active)

AIDE ‚Äì AI Design & Exploration

INAI ‚Äì Innovation + AI

LOOP ‚Äì Internal tools or Loop-specific AI work

## üîç Current Project

Code: EXAI-00001

Title: AI Agent Exploration

Description: Development and testing of a task-logging agent with persistent memory, schema design, and workflow tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Integration

This agent will eventually export daily logs in Markdown with YAML front matter, formatted for a Hugo-based static site. This will serve as a browsable, version-controlled archive of AI development work.
